# Projects-for-AI-in-Healthcare

This repository contains a collection of **applied AI and deep learning projects in healthcare**, with a focus on **medical image analysis** for disease classification and segmentation. The projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows, including data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and experimentation using modern deep learning techniques.

## 📁 Project Overview

* **Breast Cancer Classification**
  Deep learning models for classifying breast cancer cases from medical imaging data, focusing on predictive performance and clinical relevance.

* **Breast Cancer Segmentation**
  Image segmentation pipelines to localize and delineate tumor regions, supporting more precise diagnosis and treatment planning.

* **Retinal Vessel Segmentation**
  Automated segmentation of retinal blood vessels from fundus images, enabling downstream analysis for ophthalmic disease detection and risk assessment.

## 🧠 Key Themes & Skills

* Medical image classification and segmentation
* Deep learning with CNN-based architectures
* Transformers
* Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics (e.g., Dice, IoU, accuracy)

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **bridge AI research and real-world healthcare applications**, showcasing practical implementations that can support clinical decision-making, medical research, and translational Artificial Intelligence systems.
